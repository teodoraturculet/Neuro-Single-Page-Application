# Neuro-Single-Page-Application

NeuroApp is an e-learning platform for educational resources and assessments tailored for medical students, developed as part of the Programming Engineering Team Project. 

The features of this application include the ability for students to view courses and take quizzes, as well as for teachers to upload materials and create quizzes.

I contributed to the project on the **front-end** side, which was developed using **React**. I collaborated closely with the other team members to design and implement intuitive and attractive user interfaces, ensure optimal performance and responsiveness and deliver a seamless user experience.
